                        Spring Pool Glass Studio, founded by Mr. Wu Chun-Chi, has been dedicated to sustainable glass recycling for nearly 50 years.
                        Located in Hsinchu, the studio has weathered the downturn of the Hsinchu glass industry in the 1980s.

                    <p class="paragraph">
                        Seeking to foster a new generation and make sustainability a practical reality, Spring Pool envisioned "The Pool."
                        The first site for this concept was chosen next to the old Hsinchu Glass Art Museum in Hsinchu Park,
                        an abandoned glass workshop, to create a space where sustainability could thrive beyond just being a slogan.

                            To advance the second phase of service concept design and develop potential business models, I participated in interviews with potential collaborators at Hsinchu Park during the project's initial stage.
                            I compiled the gathered information, which served as essential reference material for developing service concepts.

                            The Pool is tasked with implementing and promoting a circular economy.
                            However, the circular economy itself is not a single industry but an operational model spanning various industries and economic activities.
                            Its promotion is quite complex and requires designing different production and business models tailored to the specifics of each industry
                            to effectively integrate circular economy principles.

                                After compiling various circular service case studies, we identified key elements for promoting circular economy concepts:
                                "circular stages," "behavior change methods," and "objectives."
                                By combining these elements, numerous creative ideas emerged.

							<p class="paragraph">
                                In the first co-creation workshop, we provided The Pool team with service concept idea cards and service blueprints.
                                Together, we explored the customer journey—from before they arrive, during their experience, to after they leave—and identified ways to connect each touchpoint with circular economy principles.

                                The goal was to understand customers' attitudes and opinions:
                                Do they find the concepts interesting? What might deter them?

                                The workshop aimed to build consensus among the different teams and incorporate diverse perspectives to make the service concepts more concrete and feasible.
