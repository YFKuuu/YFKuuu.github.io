                                CodingBar's primary revenue comes from winter and summer camps.
                                While summer camps perform well due to the long break, winter camps face challenges due to the shorter, fragmented holiday period.
                                Ensuring sufficient winter camp enrollments has been a persistent challenge.

                                Many parents are aware of their children's obsession with Roblox but lack understanding of its educational potential.

                                parents are unlikely to seek out or choose CodingBar's courses proactively.

                                In our initial design of the experience camp, we planned two different themes: "Parkour" and "Treasure Island."

                                        The "Parkour" ad attracted more attention than the "Treasure Island" ad, with the former's exposure and click-through rates being twice as high.

                                In the small-scale tests conducted in July and August, the "Parkour" theme proved more attractive.
                                By September, we expanded to five cities: Taipei, New Taipei, Hsinchu, Taichung, and Kaohsiung.

                                Based on the insights, we designed a new experience course titled "Foggy Forest" with a dark, suspenseful theme and shooting elements.
                                Launching in October, this course allows students who previously attended the "Parkour" experience to return, stay engaged with the brand,
                                and increase their interest in the winter camp.
