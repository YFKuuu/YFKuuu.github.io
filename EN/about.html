                        <p class="paragraph">
                            Graduated from National Cheng Kung University with a degree in Industrial Design,
                            then I was drawn to the digital realm and pursued a career in UI design and delve into the complexities of UX.
                            I am well-versed in user flows, user experience, and interface design.
                        </p>
                        <p class="paragraph">
                            At the Design Research Center, I transitioned from the "visible front stage" to the "invisible backstage,"
                            learning to identify issues and unite team consensus through service design experiences.
                            In a startup environment,  I was responsible for redesigning course landing pages, gradually stepping into the realms of marketing and product management.
                            Through user interviews and data analysis, I successfully increased visitor interaction rates,
                            combining business acumen, user experience design, and data-driven decision-making.
                        </p>
                        <p class="paragraph">
                            I love exploring the world, observing human behavior, and uncovering the "why" behind actions.
                            I excel in listening and synthesizing information, often serving as the team's bridge of understanding.
