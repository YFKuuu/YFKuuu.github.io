                        Developed a flexible exam feature within the existing system architecture to meet the needs of schools and tutoring centers.

                        CodingBar's proprietary platform allows teachers to remotely review students' code,
                        addressing issues like a shortage of programming teachers and limited learning resources.

                        Initially designed for internal use, its features and workflows were designed according to the company’s own curriculum.
                        Following its expansion, CodingBar is now adopted by over 60 high schools and junior high schools across Taiwan.
                        However, the exam functionality on the platform no longer meets the diverse needs of these educational settings,
                        prompting a redesign of the assessment features.

                                it’s essential to ensure that it aligns with the student platform’s exam features for consistency.

                                The redesigned features, while better suited to user scenarios,
                                may cause discomfort for existing users and pose a learning curve for new users unfamiliar with the overall platform.

                                The previous version of the exam feature only displayed the access point during course sessions,
                                meaning exams could only be initiated within a live class.

                                Since exams could only be conducted during class times, setting up make-up exams required creating a fake course.
                                This setup, which required the teacher to be online, added extra time costs and teaching burdens.

                                Students have different class schedules and extracurricular activities.
                                The exam system needs to allow flexible participation while maintaining testing rules.

                            <li><strong>One-Time Use of Exam Resources：</strong><br>
                                In the previous system, exam resources had to be imported into each course and could only be used once per import.
                                This method was not intuitive, requiring repeated imports for multiple uses.
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Multiple Exam Creations for Practice：</strong><br>
                                Repeated mock exams required creating multiple exams, which was time-consuming.
                                Though in-class practice supported repetition, the exam mode, which simulates timed testing scenarios,
                                needed more efficient handling for repeated use.

                                <p>Reframe the exam feature by defining its basic elements as: exam resources + exam events.</p>
                                <p>Exam papers are now treated as materials for an event, where parameters such as duration, availability, and test data provision are set for the event.

                                    To offer more flexibility for students and reduce the time burden on teachers,
                                    new features allow for setting open and close times for exam events.
                                    Teachers can schedule exams in advance, and the system will open the test at the specified time.
                                    Students can then take the test within the open period.
