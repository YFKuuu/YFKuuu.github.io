                                Text-based and blockly programming have vastly different learning models and operational methods.

                                Designing an interface that is simple and intuitive for blockly learners
                                while also supporting complex text-based programming questions is a major challenge.

                                Tablets are a more affordable option for many providers.
                                A key focus of the design is to minimize usability barriers on smaller devices.

                                        Text-Based Programming has long code length and makes reading difficult in a small coding window.

                                    <strong>Fill-in-the-Blank Questions：</strong>
                                    Specially designed for beginners, these questions need discussion regarding their definition and interaction.
                                    Conceptually, they are "learning assistance resources," but not purely guiding hints.
                                    Should they be placed within hints or integrated into the existing smart Agent to enhance interaction?

                                    The right menu provides related descriptions, hints, handouts, and other downloadable resources.
                                    Adjust the size of the main and secondary menus to establish hierarchy.
